heading: Spain Tourist Visa
description: A Spain Tourist Visa opens the door to Spain’s vibrant cities, sun-soaked coasts, and rich heritage—from Gaudí’s masterpieces in Barcelona to Andalusia’s Moorish palaces. As part of the Schengen Area, the short-stay visa generally allows up to 90 days within a 180-day period for tourism and leisure. Applicants typically need a valid passport, accommodation details, round-trip travel proof, travel insurance, and proof of funds. After applying and attending the visa appointment, you can enjoy Spain’s tapas culture, festivals, beaches, and historic towns.
