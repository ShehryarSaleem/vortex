heading: Greece Tourist Visa
description: A Greece Tourist Visa invites you to explore ancient history, island sunsets, and Mediterranean cuisine—from the Acropolis in Athens to the whitewashed villages of the Cyclades. As part of the Schengen Area, this short-stay visa generally allows visits up to 90 days within a 180-day period for tourism and leisure. Applicants typically need a valid passport, accommodation details, return travel, travel insurance, and proof of funds. After your appointment, discover Greece’s archaeological sites, beaches, and island-hopping routes.
