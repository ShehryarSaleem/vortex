As part of the Schengen Area, this short-stay visa usually permits stays up to 90 days within 180 days for tourism and leisure. Applicants typically need a valid passport, confirmed accommodation, round-trip plan, travel insurance, and proof of funds. After applying and attending the visa appointment, you can enjoy France’s gastronomy, art, history, and scenic countryside.
