heading: New Zealand Tourist Visa
description: "A New Zealand Tourist Visa lets you experience stunning landscapes, from the dramatic fjords of Milford Sound to the geothermal wonders of Rotorua and the adventure capital Queenstown. Most visitors need either a Visitor Visa or an NZeTA (New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority) depending on nationality. Applicants typically need a valid passport, proof of funds, return travel plans, and travel insurance. After approval, explore New Zealand's pristine nature, Maori culture, and world-class outdoor activities."
