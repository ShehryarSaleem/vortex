heading: Canada Tourist Visa
description: A Canada Tourist Visa (Visitor Visa) lets you experience breathtaking national parks, multicultural cities, and scenic coastlines—from the Rockies and Niagara Falls to Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. Most visitors need either a Visitor Visa (TRV) or an eTA, depending on nationality. Applicants typically require a valid passport, proof of funds and ties to home country, travel plan, and sometimes biometrics. After approval, you can enjoy Canada’s nature, culture, and welcoming cities.
